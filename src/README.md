## ðŸ§  Overview

- **isFlipLine.ts**  
  A utility to determine if a given line should be processed by the plugin (i.e., contains convertible markers).

- **extractMarkers.ts**  
  Extracts one or more valid markdown marker tokens from the beginning of a line.

- **markers.ts**  
  Centralizes all markdown marker types and their regex patterns, for consistency and maintainability.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Corresponding unit tests are located in the `test/` folder at the project root.
