# Obsidian Markdown Flip

Obsidian Markdown Flip is a plugin that helps you quickly convert markdown block types (like -, >, 1., #) by typing them at the start of a line and pressing space. You can even clear any applied block format using ~.

## ✨ Features

- Toggle between different Markdown block types by typing at the beginning of a line:
    - `-` → Bullet list
    - `1.` → Numbered list
    - `>` → Blockquote
    - `#`, `##`, `###` → Headings (H1 ~ H6)
- Remove existing block markers by typing `~` after a block marker
- Works when you press `Space` after the marker
